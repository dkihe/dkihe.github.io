Combo Translator is a fighting game notation translator aimed to help beginners who are new to fighting games.  When discussing fighting games online, many users type their combos using notations such as 'qcf+p'.  Many beginners have no idea what this is supposed to mean.  To help these beginners I created an app that turns fighting game notations into images that can clearly be read.  All you have to do is select agame, then copy and paste a notation into the input bar.  You may also type the notion into the bar.

I first thought of this project when browsing forums and seeing new fighting game players struggle with understanding the notations people typed online.  A user had suggested that someone should make an app that could help translate the notations.  I had been learning javascript during that time and had just recently heard of the library React.  I used the project as a way to develop my skills in both.  When creating the notation images, I tried to make it look as close to the game's image as possible.  Some games did not have an image for certain notations, so I had to make one up.
