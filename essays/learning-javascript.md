Is javascript a good language?  It is hard for me to compare it to other languages that I've tried since I have only a little bit of experience programming in anything else, but personally I enjoy javascript a lot more than languages like C, C++, and Java.  To me, javascript is fun and easy to use.  When using statically typed languages I always feel like things are overly complicated.  Simple things like making a function can cause annoyances.  Javascript functions are simple and intuitive.  I also enjoy the fact that I don't have to state a variables type when creating a new vcariable.  It feels flexible and fast.  Personally I enjoy dynamically typed languages campared to statically typed ones.  I also enjoyed using Lua and Python, though I don't have as much experience using those two than Javascript.

This is not nessarily a complaint about javascipt, but on how confusing webdevelopment is.  As I started learning to become a webdeveloper, I noticed that my projecrts get messy fast.  It's also difficult to get past the intial stage of learning.  If you just learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, it's now time to learn one of the many frame works or libraries that came out this week.  

I'm a person who learns best by doing the work.  I love the concept of "Athletic Software Engineering" because it seems like something that will help me become a better programmer.  I admit that I'm not the best programmer.  I overthink things which causes me to work very slowly or approach the problem in the wrong direction.  The WODs so far have shown me that I still have a long way to go.  I know I am able to complete these WODs on time, however I make mistakes that cause me to slow down.  I hope that as I do more problems, I am able to fix my mistakes and become a better programmer overall.
