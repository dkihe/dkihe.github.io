# Thoughts on Javascript
Is javascript a good language?  It is hard for me to compare it to other languages that I've tried since I have only a little bit of experience programming in anything else, but personally I enjoy javascript a lot more than languages like C, C++, and Java.  To me, javascript is fun and easy to use.  When using statically typed languages I always feel like things are overly complicated.  Simple things like making a function can cause annoyances.  Javascript functions are simple and intuitive.  I also enjoy the fact that I don't have to state a variables type when creating a new vcariable.  It feels flexible and fast.  Personally I enjoy dynamically typed languages campared to statically typed ones.  Thanks to the popularity of javascript, it's also easy to find solutions to problems you may have when programming.  I also enjoyed using Lua and Python, though I don't have as much experience using those two than Javascript.  I am still somewhat new to using ES6.  Arrow function seem straight forward, but I still get confused when using them with something like `.map()`.    

# Javascript for Web Apps
Javascript is used to make dynamic websites.  Although I'm interested in web development and web design, I realize I haven't really made a website in my life.  I have made a single web aplication that is hosted on a website, but it's a single page app.  I feel that javascript is a great language for programming applications.  There are many frameworks and libraries the creation process much faster and easier such as React or Angular.  I also think that using javascript to test applications is quick and easy.  There are times when I want to see if something works or will look nice, and I am able to test it relatively quickly (to my standards at least).  I think that javascript makes front-end development a lot more enjoyable, which is why it's so popular.

# Athletic Software Engineering
I'm a person who learns best by doing the work.  I love the concept of "Athletic Software Engineering" because it seems like something that will help me become a better programmer.  I admit that I'm not the best programmer.  I overthink things which causes me to work very slowly or approach the problem in the wrong direction.  The WODs so far have shown me that I still have a long way to go.  I know I am able to complete these WODs on time, however I make mistakes that cause me to slow down.  I hope that as I do more problems, I am able to fix my mistakes and become a better programmer overall.
